<h1>The Night king</h1>
    <p>
        The Night King was once a mortal man, one of the First Men who waged a lengthy 
        war with the Children of the Forest. As the Children were losing the war, a
         small group of greenseers captured the unfortunate man and bound him to a heart
          tree to be used for a terrible purpose. Leaf, who was among the group, pressed
           a cursed dragonglass dagger into the captive's chest, causing his eyes to
            turn blue and turning him into the first of the White Walkers. Thousands of
             years later, Leaf explains to Bran Stark that her people created the White
              Walkers to defend themselves when Westeros was invaded by the First Men,
               who were cutting their sacred trees down and slaughtering the Children of 
               the Forest.

        However, the White Walkers soon turned on their creators and began what was
         known as the Long Night.Though the Long Night ended upon the First Men and 
         Children's victory in the War for the Dawn, the Night King survived and 
         retreated with the rest of his kind to the Land of Always Winter, where they 
         hid and faded into legend.
